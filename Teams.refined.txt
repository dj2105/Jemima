But, I think what cx is arguing is that he never requested it to be moved, planning then to pay bills instead of getting lump sum httc. if that's the case, then would it be bt's responsibility to have explained the risk of a takeover happening, or the fact it happened would be considered cx's responsibility?

Message: if a request to take over an account comes in, the customer would need to call up to place cancellation, he was aware that someone was after moving into the property and had already requested a takeover before, so he knew it could happen again. the notes indicate the all that happened on the 17th was the cancelled the first takeover request. if he disputes it you can raise a DSAR request to grab the call but there was never a home move order placed and from the fact that he wanted to pay off the current service at the property he didnt want a home move either as a home move would have put him into a new contract

I haven't told them that the credit has been rejected, but I can't be totally sure that the credit rejection in notes is for the credit which had been offered by ecr. I'm out till Thursday now. I have told customer that the will be notified as soon as there is news. I have been communicating with Jane, account holders wife, as requested by account holder. Thank you

Message: Hi Noel,This is a difficult message to send as I'm new to the team and don't want to start by raising problems, but I do need to be honest.Thanks for replying, though I was a little confused by your message. What had left me frustrated was not hearing back when I first asked last week, and knowing I wouldn't get a response for another week because of our shifts. I want to be clear - I never mentioned this to other staff or framed it as an issue caused by you. In the original request and notes I explained that, due to the customer's past dissatisfaction, I'd committed to keep the complaint open until they confirmed the credit had landed.I saw you raised the comp and gave it a thumbs up, but refused auto-comp requests now follow a new procedure, and it was that "what happens next?" point I was trying to clarify. When I shared our conversation in the credit chat, it was only to provide context - never to undermine you.Unfortunately this is just one of a number of dead ends I'm facing, and it's causing me a lot of stress which is affecting my logins and offline time. I've raised these difficulties with Shannon Williamson and Jessica O'Driscoll but haven't had any real support. This isn't a criticism of you - I've only had about 1.5 days working with you since joining your team, and without support in your absence I've been left stuck.I do have a one-to-one with you tomorrow, and if you'd prefer to cover this then I'm happy to wait. I just wanted to explain where I'm coming from today. I'm confident I can get past this and learn from it, and I really would like a good working relationship with you and colleagues. I hope neither this message nor my difficulties stand in the way of that.

Message: Excuse me if I'm a bit prickly about this. I also know I could have avoided this situation by logging in on time. But the truth is I'm struggling at the moment. I was moved to Noel's team on 18 August, and I've only had 1.5 days when he's been in (although I was on holiday 1 week) and no support other than the group chat at all other times. I've got a backlog of things I need advice about, some of which I've raised in the group chat and not received feedback about, or only received very vague guidance which puts me in a difficult position with customers. I've got call listens which haven't been done from mid august, and the whole thing is very stressful. I'm well aware it's not how infosys wish me to handle the situation, but after punching in at 9am, I delayed logging in as I looked though some outstanding issues in the hope of getting them resolved. Not that it really helped. I reached out to Jessica O'Drisscoll about this yesterday, and all she said was that I can use the group chat and she'll tell Noel about it (which is of little benefit in my attempts of help customers now)

Message: co-pilot says: Thanks for the context—your messages in blue show you’re actively handling the customer's concerns. Based on what's been shared, here's a quick breakdown to help you decide whether a team leader (TL) should step in:
🤝 When TL Involvement Might Be Needed
* "Escalation Request": If the customer explicitly asks to speak to a manager or TL.
* "Unresolved Frustration": The customer is clearly unhappy with BT, feels misled about the deposit refund timeline, and has experienced delays due to credit checks. If they're losing trust or becoming irate, a TL might help de-escalate.
* "Policy Exception or Compensation": If the customer is requesting something outside standard process—like early refund or compensation—a TL may need to approve or explain the decision.
* "Repeated Issues": If this isn't the first time the customer has contacted BT about this and feels ignored or bounced around, TL involvement can show accountability.
✅ When You Might Handle It Yourself
* If the customer is still engaging calmly and you're able to explain the situation clearly.
* If you've already offered next steps (e.g., submitting the auto compensation form) and they're receptive.
* If you're confident the issue can be resolved without needing higher authority.
You're doing a solid job navigating a tricky situation. If you feel the customer's trust is slipping or they're asking for something you can't authorize, escalating to TL is the right move.

Message: Eamonn, I've just come back from my break and about to call the customer back. Really I don't think that I have anything to add to when I last spoke to them, and certainly I don't have anything to present which gives an answer to either of their primary moans i.e. evidence of information communicated about deposit and (which we didn't discuss earlier) the failed promises given by agents that they will be called back, and coupled with that the fact the complaint was closed without permission given by customer , and no evidence that attemts were made to contact them.
I'm going to feel a little silly calling back regarding the request to speak to a manager, if I am then unable to progress the case forward and am then left with the same request to speak to a manager.

Date / time: 08/09 17:22
Message: I called the customer as promised and reiterated the current deposit policy and refund timeline. During the call, I acknowledged the lack of documented communication and the customer's concerns around misinformed expectations. As discussed, I've raised a DSAR request on the customer's behalf to allow them access to any relevant call recordings or data from the past 12 months.
While the account holder, Rick, has learning difficulties, I've been speaking with Fiona, a registered third party on the account, following explicit verbal consent from Rick during the initial call. Fiona has been the primary point of contact throughout the complaint and is acting on Rick's behalf. Although I understand that any formal resolution may require direct contact with the account holder, I recommend proceeding with Fiona for now to ensure clarity and accessibility.
The customer appreciated the transparency and is awaiting further contact from a manager, as previously requested. Please let me know if you're able to take the callback forward or if further action is needed on my side.

There is currently a home move order on her account, which will cease her broadband and landline. She has no knowledge of the transfer, and has been very argumentative. From speaking to her, I think it's clear that if the landline cancels on 3rd oct, as scheduled, this will cause her problems. However, she has now hung up the phone, saying that I was talking rubbish, and saying there must be some sort of phantom at bt.

Her family have recently got rid of their landline, and they had told her that calling their mobiles wouldn't cost her any more than she'd been paying. I will of course get her moved to unlimited call plan, but can we make any bill shock type refunds on this occasion? She say's she's unable to pay such a high bill and is quite distressed about it.

The customer was furious on the call on monday, saying we're thieves and calling him a liar. Saying that the only option now is to wait a month for dsar results could at least be softened by explaining that we can suspend any further payments until dsar results are in. Sending him the contract isn't acknowledging there's been an error on the account which he may not be liable for.
Sender: Noel Curran (XBC26 C)
Date / time: 09/10 16:07
Message: I see that but, the TV has been active since last year, the only way we have now of confirming if the contract is correct or not is with the DSAR as we no longer have the calls, He hasnt been getting charged for tv in at least the last 11/12 months when realistically we should have been. I understand where he is coming from about the increase itself but he would have had the 14 days Cooling off to dispute anything about the contract itself. But you are the one whos going to be handling the call so go forward as you see fit.

when I raise a dsar I have to read "Call recordings are kept for 1 year and then are automatically deleted in accordance with our policy." and get confirmation this has been understood. Given that the calls are over a year old, I don't think he'll take that very well. What do you suggest? (it's not my aim to be difficult Noel, promise!)

Message: Hi Jessica. I hope you're well. Sorry about this long one! Noel tells me you're potentially available if I need to escalate. I have a callback to do which seems absolutely certain it will require escalation.
[redacted] called in very angry on monday. after one year where he wasn't being fully billed for his tv, suddenly on his latest bill, the full tv price was added to his bill, increasing it by £45.
Having spoken to DI about it, they confirmed there had been a glitch, but the new monthly charges of 106.99 are now correct.
Jason had offered to search for the call when the original order was placed, as cx insists he was promised tv at £6. I was off tues/weds, but jason said he would check the call ready for today. However, Jason is off today and I can't find any evidence he looked for the call.
I told Noel who advised we wouldn't have it as it's over a year ago. Noel advised I call cx and raise a dsar if that's what it came to. However, I pointed out I have to get confirmation from customer they understand "Call recordings are kept for 1 year and then are automatically deleted in accordance with our policy." Noel agreed in that case a dsar wasn't suitable to offer.
And so, I really have nothing to go back to the customer with, and feel the only thing I can do is offer to escalate.
I've been trying to sort this out all day, and missed the callback time of 3pm. I can see from notes the customer has already called in today, chasing the callback. It also doesn't seem to have progressed, and from talking to him on monday, I would be shocked if he's agreed to pay the additional £45. The complaint I opened on Monday remains open.
Given that I have nothing further to offer the customer, I have delayed calling back until I can be confident someone will be available to discuss his case when I do call. He was very critical of waiting last time we spoke, and on a very short fuse.

[Quoted] Hey Jason. Did you get an opportunity to look for this call?
Jason - believe me, I'd rather not be raising this again. I did raise with noel, who was unable to find call. I don't feel it's appropriate raising a dsar as the statement we're obliged to get agreement to clearly says calls are kept for maximum of 1 year, and call is over a year ago.
This left me with nothing to offer cx, other than escalation. Based on that, I tried coordinating with noel so he'd be available to take call when I called cx back,. Based on how angry cx was before, I felt calling him up and then making him wait for ages while I organised someone to take the call was best avoided. Without going into details, I attempted to co-ordinate with another TL before call but without success. I'm under pressure to get my complaints closed today.
I'll try calling cx this afternoon, can you be available when I do? Is there anything I could offer to try preventing escalation?

before (home move) she had home essentials account [redacted] active april - july this year
On this old account she had tv at offer price of £1/month. she says she never wanted the tv. since the home move, the cancelled account has applied cease fees of 277.91 for tv service.
she now has dca chasing her for this. i can't find any evidence on account that she requested tv service to cease, but she says she never wanted it/never used it. I suspect that as it was only £1 she didn't put much effort into cancellation.
what are the chances of getting tv cease fees cancelled?

Message: Sorry I've logged in late today, and that I haven't yet called the customer I said I would contact first thing. This particular case has made me feel quite uncomfortable, and I felt it was appropriate to take some time to review Ofcom's regulations before proceeding.
From what I've read, the route I'm expected to take doesn't seem to align fully with General Condition C4 and the Ofcom-approved Complaints Code, which require that providers follow a clear process to investigate complaints, tell the customer the outcome of that investigation, and, if the issue remains unresolved, issue a written response or ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) letter.
Could you clarify how I should proceed on this call? After I explain to the customer that the sales call can't be found, and that you've told me the httc still apply, what should I then be offering or advising her?
I completely understand that you want this complaint closed, but I hope you can appreciate that part of my responsibility as an agent is to be aware of Ofcom's regulations and flag any potential areas of non-compliance. My aim is to act correctly and uphold compliance standards – not to avoid work.
Sender: Noel Curran (XBC26 C)
Date / time: 20/10 15:51
Message: Can I first ask a reason for being late, the resolution for the complaint would be that the HTTC would stand as no call was found and customer only made contact with us mentioning they did not want the TV after it was cancelled. We don't have to offer anything, not all cases would require something offered, again this is similar to the other call back you had, I cant advise you on what to say until you make the call back as I can not guarantee how the customer is going to react to the situation.
The call i had this morning that was over 2 hours long was in relation to complaints as is our training at 4 today. once a complaint has been opened for 54 days automatically a deadlock letter is sent, A deadlock letter costs 265 per letter sent to a customer. the reason why not only myself but the client are asking guides to close complaints within a short window is to avoid cases going to deadlock, Between Jan - Aug this year EE/BT has spent 1.3 million on deadlock letters. Of course there will be cases that will warrant deadlocks being raised but that would have to be escalated properly ( so starting with you, then myself, then ECR and then deadlock).
I am in no way asking you to go against compliance standards. What I am asking is that you follow the guidance set by the client you have relayed the information to myself. so I can do the same with the team.

so we you first said about this call to me it was at 16:07, you would have had roughly the next 4 hours after that point to call the customer back when I was available, you dont know how the call is going to go until you call him back, if it was the customer request the he wants to escalate after that point that if fine but you dont need to have a manager lined up waiting to escalate the call, I have given you every possible option that anyone would be able to do for him regardless of seniority. all thats left to do is call the customer back, the longer that you wait to call him back the more unhappy he is going to be as promises were broken, so he is bound to be angry off the get go before you even mention any call findings or lack there of to him

just in relation to this, can you share which regulation that you were looking at that wouldnt support the complaint being closed, going from the note thats on the complaint " cease order not successful in past resulting in being overcharged since move to virgin. " the resolution for this would be getting the account closed, no where does it mention about needing to wait for final bill. while it is mentioned in the action on the account it would still need to be mentioned in the complaint itself if you are leaving the complaint open for this reason. the issue they called into you with was that the cease order failed and that they would need to be refunded for charges which we are unable to do so until the final bill comes through, there is notes on the account from a previous agent to say that once the final bill comes through we will refund any HTTC from the account.
Sender: Daniel Jackson
Date / time: 17/10 15:25 Edited
Message: Thanks for discussing this Noel. I was looking at Ofcom's general condition C4 and the complaints code under it (paragraphs 7 + 14). It says we've got to keep taking steps to resolve a complaint until it's actually resolved or properly closed.
In this case the final bill and refund still need to happen, so I'm just not sure how that counts as resolved. I do understand that credits will go on later, but that's kind of the core of what she raised, and she's understandably concerned that promises won't be met.
I'm not trying to make things awkward. But I also value part of my role being able to genuinely help customers. That doesn't mean I am predisposed to telling them what they want to hear, but it does mean I want to be confident I'm working within regulations. If there's any internal guidance that says it's ok to close at this stage, can you share it? This would help me understand for next time.

Message: Hi Jess, wondering if you can help. I spoke to [redacted] yesterday who was getting in contact as he'd received a bill since cease order had gone through. I explained the process and all seemed well, but it then transpired he expects to be leave without httc.
His presentation of it is that there's been a long standing understanding by ee that speeds in his area are so slow, that he had the right to leave if they didn't improve. he says this dates back over two years.
The only recent evidence he thinks could be located is a call in July or August with an agent in Northern Ireland. I've had a look at calls around this time though and can't find evidence.
Tech have confirmed an engineer visit for slow speeds, but say the speeds, although slow, didn't fall below guarantee.
Perhaps this shouldn't be taken into account, but he is a former mp and lawyer, and comes across as such! He's been quite vocal about going to regulators if this causes any problems. I did say I would call him today with an update.

Message: these are my notes from yesterday when I spoke to him. I just called back today confirming that httc would apply (decision from Jess):
CX called unhappy re: bill issued after cease. Advised final bill still to be produced.
Cease had been delayed; checked account to ensure no issues clearing charges once final bill generated.
CX claimed he was told no notice period/HTTC due to very slow speeds + no upgrade planned. No evidence found to support this.
Connections confirmed slow speeds but no record of waiver. Tech confirmed engineer visit for drops, but no speeds below guarantee.
Informed CX no evidence of promise to waive fees; advised possible resolution if call recording located. CX recalled speaking to NI agent late June/early Aug; no matching call found.
CX stated arrangement dates back to complaint during recontracting a couple of years ago when told new lines were coming soon and he'd be free to leave if not delivered.
CX warned he will escalate to Ofcom/Ombudsman if charges applied.

The fact is clear - his account is terminated, and he terminated believing that httc would not be applied.

before (home move) she had home essentials account [redacted] active april - july this year
On this old account she had tv at offer price of £1/month. she says she never wanted the tv. since the home move, the cancelled account has applied cease fees of 277.91 for tv service.
she now has dca chasing her for this. i can't find any evidence on account that she requested tv service to cease, but she says she never wanted it/never used it. I suspect that as it was only £1 she didn't put much effort into cancellation.
what are the chances of getting tv cease fees cancelled?

Date / time: 20/10 14:24
Message: Sorry I've logged in late today, and that I haven't yet called the customer I said I would contact first thing. This particular case has made me feel quite uncomfortable, and I felt it was appropriate to take some time to review Ofcom's regulations before proceeding.
From what I've read, the route I'm expected to take doesn't seem to align fully with General Condition C4 and the Ofcom-approved Complaints Code, which require that providers follow a clear process to investigate complaints, tell the customer the outcome of that investigation, and, if the issue remains unresolved, issue a written response or ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) letter.
Could you clarify how I should proceed on this call? After I explain to the customer that the sales call can't be found, and that you've told me the httc still apply, what should I then be offering or advising her?
I completely understand that you want this complaint closed, but I hope you can appreciate that part of my responsibility as an agent is to be aware of Ofcom's regulations and flag any potential areas of non-compliance. My aim is to act correctly and uphold compliance standards – not to avoid work.
Sender: Noel Curran (XBC26 C)
Date / time: 20/10 15:51
Message: Can I first ask a reason for being late, the resolution for the complaint would be that the HTTC would stand as no call was found and customer only made contact with us mentioning they did not want the TV after it was cancelled. We don't have to offer anything, not all cases would require something offered, again this is similar to the other call back you had, I cant advise you on what to say until you make the call back as I can not guarantee how the customer is going to react to the situation.
The call i had this morning that was over 2 hours long was in relation to complaints as is our training at 4 today. once a complaint has been opened for 54 days automatically a deadlock letter is sent, A deadlock letter costs 265 per letter sent to a customer. the reason why not only myself but the client are asking guides to close complaints within a short window is to avoid cases going to deadlock, Between Jan - Aug this year EE/BT has spent 1.3 million on deadlock letters. Of course there will be cases that will warrant deadlocks being raised but that would have to be escalated properly ( so starting with you, then myself, then ECR and then deadlock).
I am in no way asking you to go against compliance standards. What I am asking is that you follow the guidance set by the client you have relayed the information to myself. so I can do the same with the team.

ok that is understandable but we still cant be leaving complaints open for this length of time, while I appreciate you trying to do as much as possible for the customer, that isnt your job to follow up on, you have done your part with this. any credits that are due would be done by the agent when the customer calls back in not yourself.

so we you first said about this call to me it was at 16:07, you would have had roughly the next 4 hours after that point to call the customer back when I was available, you dont know how the call is going to go until you call him back, if it was the customer request the he wants to escalate after that point that if fine but you dont need to have a manager lined up waiting to escalate the call, I have given you every possible option that anyone would be able to do for him regardless of seniority. all thats left to do is call the customer back, the longer that you wait to call him back the more unhappy he is going to be as promises were broken, so he is bound to be angry off the get go before you even mention any call findings or lack there of to him

just in relation to this, can you share which regulation that you were looking at that wouldnt support the complaint being closed, going from the note thats on the complaint " cease order not successful in past resulting in being overcharged since move to virgin. " the resolution for this would be getting the account closed, no where does it mention about needing to wait for final bill. while it is mentioned in the action on the account it would still need to be mentioned in the complaint itself if you are leaving the complaint open for this reason. the issue they called into you with was that the cease order failed and that they would need to be refunded for charges which we are unable to do so until the final bill comes through, there is notes on the account from a previous agent to say that once the final bill comes through we will refund any HTTC from the account.
Sender: Daniel Jackson
Date / time: 17/10 15:25 Edited
Message: Thanks for discussing this Noel. I was looking at Ofcom's general condition C4 and the complaints code under it (paragraphs 7 + 14). It says we've got to keep taking steps to resolve a complaint until it's actually resolved or properly closed.
In this case the final bill and refund still need to happen, so I'm just not sure how that counts as resolved. I do understand that credits will go on later, but that's kind of the core of what she raised, and she's understandably concerned that promises won't be met.
I'm not trying to make things awkward. But I also value part of my role being able to genuinely help customers. That doesn't mean I am predisposed to telling them what they want to hear, but it does mean I want to be confident I'm working within regulations. If there's any internal guidance that says it's ok to close at this stage, can you share it? This would help me understand for next time.

Message: Hi Jess, wondering if you can help. I spoke to [redacted] yesterday who was getting in contact as he'd received a bill since cease order had gone through. I explained the process and all seemed well, but it then transpired he expects to be leave without httc.
His presentation of it is that there's been a long standing understanding by ee that speeds in his area are so slow, that he had the right to leave if they didn't improve. he says this dates back over two years.
The only recent evidence he thinks could be located is a call in July or August with an agent in Northern Ireland. I've had a look at calls around this time though and can't find evidence.
Tech have confirmed an engineer visit for slow speeds, but say the speeds, although slow, didn't fall below guarantee.
Perhaps this shouldn't be taken into account, but he is a former mp and lawyer, and comes across as such! He's been quite vocal about going to regulators if this causes any problems. I did say I would call him today with an update.

Date / time: 19/10 16:34 Edited
Message: these are my notes from yesterday when I spoke to him. I just called back today confirming that httc would apply (decision from Jess):
CX called unhappy re: bill issued after cease. Advised final bill still to be produced.
Cease had been delayed; checked account to ensure no issues clearing charges once final bill generated.
CX claimed he was told no notice period/HTTC due to very slow speeds + no upgrade planned. No evidence found to support this.
Connections confirmed slow speeds but no record of waiver. Tech confirmed engineer visit for drops, but no speeds below guarantee.
Informed CX no evidence of promise to waive fees; advised possible resolution if call recording located. CX recalled speaking to NI agent late June/early Aug; no matching call found.
CX stated arrangement dates back to complaint during recontracting a couple of years ago when told new lines were coming soon and he'd be free to leave if not delivered.
CX warned he will escalate to Ofcom/Ombudsman if charges applied.

Sender: Daniel Jackson
Date / time: 19/10 16:48
Message: I don't really understand why you can't take an escalation based on something which we know is going to happen. As far as EE is concerned right now, there is no need to dispute httc, because he is liable for them. The fact is clear - his account is terminated, and he terminated believing that httc would not be applied.

so i cant dispute charges that there is no proof of having

also arte you logged off your phone panel ?

Date / time: 19/10 16:59
Message: yes I am, because I don't want to get stuck on a call and not be in a position to discuss this with you. I just called him back and promised a manager would contact him today, and with the end of the day rapidly approaching, it feels like that promise could very easily be broken

Date / time: 19/10 17:12
Message: I agree i have no idea if they are going to be or not - cant find any evidence to support that they will be nevermind an amount i have looked through all order cease confirmation comms and doesn't mention any HTTC charges that's why I cant even take the call to discuss them. I agree it is a weird one cause doesn't say on email. I have spoke to Jason here with me about it also and he agrees there is nothing we can do unless there is proof of them

Message: I really don't want to argue Keelyn. But as someone who would like to help customers where possible, this job can feel like a battle. I have gone out of my way for the customer I have brought to you for escalation, and it's disappointing that my promise to him is being broken. You have not only refused to take it, you've also not given any guidance following that decision.

Chat name: NOEL ’S TEAM
Date: MON 31/10
Sender: Daniel Jackson
Date / time: 31/10 16:47
Message: GB29780292 is an 85 year old lady who recently lost her husband. she went to the brixton store to reduce costs, and decided to remove her landline from account. instead of simply removing the landline, the staff there cancelled her existing contract, and then sold her a more expensive package, with more than she needs/wants. this was hidden by the fact it comes with 3 months free.
She has contacted us about this already, very unhappy that her broadband will be 46.99/month, where previously it was 35.99. She has been advised that she must return to store to dispute, which she has done a couple of times, but she says that each time the staff there have been very rude and told her that there isn't a manager available in the store for her to speak to. She says that she will not return to the store because they were so rude.
She says she doesn't know what to do next. What should I suggest?

He is upset as he is being charged £55.86 where he should only be charged £48.99 as per new package but for some reason cyber security was added without account reason for his call yesterday. was advised that the cyber security would get removed but received a text about his bill today as £55.86.

Everyone TL available? Customer is not happy that duplicate account was setup and have been billed in the two account GB32324377 and GB32451131. Cx have been paying into the GB32324377 account but was meant for the other account. I can see that the credit has been applied to the GB32451131 account so that the GB32324377 can be closed. I can see that this account is still active though no active asset. I have tried to assist the cx but will not listen as this has been an ongoing issue. Customer just want to speak to a manager.

Any TL to take an escalation? Thanks
Cx’s asking for a manager - they’ve been pinged-ponged between 4 different departments and I asked them if I can solve their query - No, they stand their ground. Want a manager. It was a transfer by 617915292 who was doing the removal of the HTTC + cancellation but all of a sudden they threw cx onto me. Any TL to take this call?
Vladislav Belov (XBXW64 C) — 04/12 14:42

Got someone here saying they ceased acc last month, acc was not ceased but notes say they can leave no HTTCs. Cx looking for last month to be refunded (£71.20). Can this be applied?
Allen Axi (XBC26 C) — 05/12 12:18
The customer claims a credit check was run on her without consent. She says she reported it in November, but nothing was done. The agent told her it had been escalated to a manager for a callback, yet she never received one cx says she wants to speak to a manager.
